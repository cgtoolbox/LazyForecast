"LazyForecast"

For fun ! :)

A small python script which will answer for you to the question: "Should I take my raincoat today to go to work ??"
It will send you a SMS direclty on your phone with a nice message saying if you have or have not to take your raincoat today :)
It actually checks the weather forcast for the next 12 hours ( up to 48 hours ). It will also give you the min and max temperature !

The script can be used with free or trial API and providers. It's based on:

Twilio, to send SMS ( free trial to one verified phone number )
Weatherbit, free to get weather forcast hourly for the next 48 hours
pythonanywhere, free up to one app and one daily task. This allows you to run the script daily, say, every morning, 5 minutes before you leave for work ? :)
